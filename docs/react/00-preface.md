# Preface & Philosophy

This book curates deep React engineering knowledge from the existing repository docs and expands them with structured explanations, patterns, and decision frameworks.

## Goals

- Provide senior-level clarity on core mechanisms (rendering, concurrency, state).
- Offer pragmatic guidance for production concerns (performance, testing, accessibility, security).
- Serve as an interview preparation companion and on-boarding manual.

## Structure

Each chapter follows a consistent pattern:

1. Concept Overview
2. Deep Theory & Internals
3. Practical Examples
4. Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
5. Decision Guidelines / Trade-offs
6. References & Further Reading

## Source Materials

Derived from: `REACT_MASTERY_GUIDE.md`, `Hooks_Deep_Dive.md`, `STATE_MANAGEMENT.md`, `DESIGN_PATTERNS.md`, `REDUX_TOOLKIT.md`, `TANSTACK_QUERY.md`, and other repository examples.
